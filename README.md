# Emco maximat v10 Metric conversion
In firs time i want to buy lathe in Metric scale ,but by my huge misstake and under the influence of excitement,i am badly check up and after i bring it home i find out the lathe was in INCH ( what i will do ?) i never ever use inch scale in my life. I start search                someting , what or who can help me sort out this proble.
After while i find fantastic groupe of people aroud world which has similar type of lathes and they give me lot of answers and help me make decision - DO METRIC KONVERSION - first i start to investigate how much is lathe worn out , more important was bed,worn out was 0,10 -very bad - on main prismatic ways, on tailstock ways was 0,01-not bad  ,spindle bearing ok but upgrade can only help ,also i decise  
       replace all bronze bushes and bring lathe to very very close brand new specification.
Huge problem was to find in Ireland some company which can regrinding all bed, afer 6 month searching and couple hundrits euro for telephone bill by call to Polend ,Czech Republic ,England i find one for relativly reasonable price in czech republic, company with years        of experience do this job , find some carrier was nex challenge .

Every job which was done on lathe even is very smole was unbeliveble challenge ,if you have no friends around or somebody who can help you. Lot of parts was make by my friend ( turning and milling ) in my native country Czech Republic 3000 km fare a way, because in   
       ireland is this service very very expensive and not to easy find if you have not information.
Lathe has rechroming all hand wheels which are from zink-alu and very dificult to rechoreme and only one company is abble to do it in 
       czech republic, preparation you can see on pictures.
Paint is 3K poyuretane very durible an oil resistant i thing is beautiful.
All blackening parts which durin years lost black couting was restore by original methode HOT BLACKENING ( not by chemical bluening ) firs i send it to company which it prowided and later i lern how do it ,bought chemical salt end rest of parts i blackening my self.
         
         WHAT IS THE CONVERSION OF A MACHINE REPRESENTS : REPLACE-
metric quadrant arm ,all lead screws , scalen rings, all name plates, all leadscrews nodes, tailstock quil, feeding gearbox, half node
if you like tu buy new cost can go over 2500 eu ( brand new ),so i decised to buy use parts or lathe for parts ,so i was lucky and buy    donation metric lathe for parts,so most this parts i had and can continue my conversion.
                       
         WHICH PARTS HAVE BIN REPLACED OR REPAIRED   
REPLACED PARTS for brand new - all bearings in specification C2 - SKF,NSK + bushes, half node ( brand new ),gears on metric quadrant + reverse gears, all bolts , all name plates on lathe ,paint ,new el.cables for both motors,new wipers,new oil sign ,grease nipples,
