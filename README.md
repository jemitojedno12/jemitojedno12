# Emco maximat v10 arrive home
When first time arrive at home this lathe i have been very happy -but not long time ,by my huge misstake and under the influence of excitement when i buy, i find out the lathe was in INCH ( what i will do ?) i never ever use inch scale in my life. I start search someting what cen help me with sort out this proble.After while i find fantastic groupe of people aroud world which has similar type of lathes and they give me lot of answers and help me make decision - METRIC KONVERSION - first i start to investigate how much is lathe worn out , more important was bed worn out is 0,10 -very bad - on main prismatic ways,0,01-not bad -on tailstock ways ,spindle bearing ok but upgrade can only help ,also bronze bushe i decise replaceit and bring lathe to very very close to brand new spec.Huge problem was to find in Ireland some company which can regriinding all bed afer 6 month and couple hundrits for telephone bill by call to Polend ,Czech Republic ,England i find one for relativly reasonable price in czech republic in company with years of experience do this job , find some carrier was nex challenge .
Every job which was done on lathe even is very smole was unbeliveble challenge if you have no friends around or somebody who can help,lot of parts was make by my friend ( turning and milling ) in my native country Czech Republic because in ireland is this service very very expensive .
Lathe has rechroming all hand wheels which are from zink alu and very dificul to rechoreme,preparation you can see on pictures.
Paint is 3K very durible an oil resistant i ting is beautiful.
All blackening parts which durin eayrs lost black couting was restore by original methode HOT BLACKENING ( no by chemical bluening ) firs i send it to company which it prowided  
     and later i lern how do it end some smole parts i blackening my self .
